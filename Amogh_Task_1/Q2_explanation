since only larger can be converted to smaller, we start with large demand and supply

I take a variable count to denote how many people can become happy

so for the largest shirt, if demand > supply, then no use of converting them into smaller ones since making one person unhappy to make another happy doesn't change the net count 
if supply > demand, we can convert all excess ones into the one smaller, since they wont get used and might get used for the smaller one

same for the middle shirt

for the smallest shirt, same logic but we leave out the conversion since it cant be converted into everything, excess shirts don't matter to us at this point

so when supply > demand then I add the demand value to count
if demand > supply, then I add the supply value to count
