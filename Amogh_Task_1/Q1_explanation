if distance before rest (x) > total distance (y)
then 0 stops 

so in order to find no of stops for y> x, we basically want to know how many x's fit in a y
so we do floor division

only 1 exception when y is a multiple of x 
then the last stop is after he has completed the race, so that wont count 
so then we do floor (y/x) - 1
otherwise we do floor(y/x)
